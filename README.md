# Udacity: Machine Learning Engineer
## Projects

### Overview

This repository includes projects completed in relation to the Machine Learning Engineer program, provided by Udacity (www.udacity.com). 

### Titanic Survival Exploration

Exploratory data analysis that extracts general data summaries based on survivor data from the Titanic

### Boston Housing

Regression analysis done on housing prices in Boston based on key features such as location, school zone, and square footage. Aim of analysis is to build a regression model that predicts the price of a new Boston house (test entry).

### Student Intervention

Supervised learning project conducted on simulated data from a classroom of students. Learning goal is to determine which students need intervention (re: extra help) based on training and test data.

### Creating Customer Segments

Unsupervised learning project conducted on sales data of various food produce from different locations. Learning goal is to identify clusters of similar vendors, and create a set of vendor profiles (e.g. liquor store/bodega, grocery store/supermarket, cafe/restaurant).

### Smartcab

Reinforcement learning project using expectation maximization algorithm to train a self-driving taxi to navigate itself from a starting location to a destination in a Manhattan city block. Rewards are defined by avoiding collisions with other cars, obeying traffic signals, and reching destination within allotted time.
